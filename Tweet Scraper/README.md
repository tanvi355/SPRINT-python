# Tweet Scraper of BlueLearn's founders
## Made as a part of BlueLearn's SPRINT

## Issue number: 7

## Description:

This script uses the `twint` package to scrape tweets from Twitter without using any API and stores them
in a `csv` file by the name of the user whose tweets were fetched.

- The output files are also attached here.

`This script scrapes the tweets of @curiousharish and @Shreyans_23 only for the purpose of submission in the SPRINT.`
