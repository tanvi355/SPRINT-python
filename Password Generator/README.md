# Password Generator
### Made by - [Tanvi](https://github.com/tanvi355)

## Issue number: 4

## Description:

This script generates a random password based on two criteria provided by the user:
- Length of password
- Strength of password
    - Low (L)
    - Medium (M)
    - High (H)

Both of these criteria are just for the purpose of making the script a little more functioning and do not follow any official criteria.

The script starts by displaying a message about what details are to be provided by the user and then asks for input.
If incorrect input is given then a message regarding that will be displayed, else a random password will be printed based on the given strength and length.
